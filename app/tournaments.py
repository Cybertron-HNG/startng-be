"""Daily tournaments.

Every day a few random games (settings.tournament_games, 5) make up a tournament that runs for 24 hours and
ends in the evening (settings.tournament_end_hour, Nigeria time). Players enter by sharing it on X, then
play: while they're entered, every run a game sends to start.ng (POST /games/<name>/scores, the same call as
always, so games need no changes) also counts in the tournament, where only runs inside its 24 hours count.

When it ends, each game's tournament board gives points by place (POINTS, then 1 for everyone else who
played it). The player with the most points wins the day. Points only ever come from tournaments, so old
games can't be farmed, and the overall leaderboard adds them up (all time, or this week).

Nothing runs on a timer: the day's tournament is made the first time anyone asks for it, and a tournament
that has ended is settled (points saved, winner named) the next time anyone looks. Unique constraints make
both safe when two requests do it at once.
