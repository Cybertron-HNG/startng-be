"""Live rooms for multiplayer games, like the start.ng Hangout.

A game never holds the player's sign-in. It asks start.ng's /connect page for a one-minute
ticket (POST /games/{name}/ticket), then opens the WebSocket /games/{name}/live?ticket=...
The server reads the ticket and attaches the player's real name and look from the database,
so nobody can pretend to be someone else. Rooms live in this process's memory.

Seats: the most recently active start.ng users (up to MAX_SEATS) each get a numbered seat. A
seat holder who isn't in the room sits there; when they come in, they stand up from it, and
when they leave they're back in it. Seat numbers stay put for as long as the server runs, so
everyone sees each person in the same seat. Only a player moves their own character.

Messages (JSON text):
  server -> you     {type: "welcome", you, players: [player], seats: [resident], chat: [chat]}
  server -> others  {type: "join", player} | {type: "move", id, x, z, ry, moving}
                    {type: "wave", id} | {type: "leave", id, seat}
  server -> all     {type: "chat", id, name, text, at}   (everyone in the room, the sender too)
  you -> server     {type: "move", x, z, ry, moving} | {type: "wave"} | {type: "chat", text}
  player            {id, name, style, seat, x, z, ry, moving}
                    (x and z are null until they first move: they're standing at their seat)
  resident          {id, name, style, seat}   everyone with a seat, in the room or not
  chat              {id, name, text, at}   (at: milliseconds since 1970, set by the server)
  style null means: use start.ng's starting look for that id.

Chat: the room keeps its last 50 messages and sends them in the welcome, so a player who comes in
sees what was said. Text is trimmed, cut to 200 characters and has control characters removed;
an empty message, or one sent too soon after the last (0.7 s), is dropped.
